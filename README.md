Development repository for Stargazer - an indie sci-fi exploration project centered on environmental storytelling, design systems, and procedural worldbuilding.

# Stargazer

*A sci‑fi exploration project set on a world that remembers everything it has lost.*

**Stargazer** is an independent world‑building and design project exploring the intersection of art, science, and philosophy through the lens of a desolate ocean planet — **Nereus**.  
It blends art, procedural environments, and cinematic storytelling to construct a cohesive narrative world grounded in geology, emotion, and myth.

## Overview

A **third‑person exploration experience** that blurs the line between **science fiction** and **spiritual allegory**.  
The player is stranded on Nereus — a storm‑swept planet scarred by an ancient cataclysm.  
Beneath its endless rain and glass‑scarred cliffs lie echoes of a civilization that once reached beyond the stars, only to fall back into the sea.
Developed in Unreal Engine, the project leverages real-time rendering to achieve cinematic realism, environmental storytelling, and atmospheric immersion.

## Creative Direction

| Element | Description |
|---|---|
| **Tone** | Somber, reflective, mysterious — a quiet descent into memory. |
| **Visual Style** | Cinematic realism with painterly composition. Influences include *Annihilation*, *Alien: Covenant*, *Prometheus*, and *Death Stranding*. |
| **Aesthetic Philosophy** | Wabi‑sabi, duality, and the beauty of erosion — everything beautiful must first decay. |
| **Core Symbols** | Water, light, glass, and reflection — mirrors of creation and ruin. |

## Design Philosophy

- **Science as Myth:** Every geological formation and weather pattern tells a story.  
- **World as Character:** Nereus is not inhabited - it *remembers*. Its landscapes mourn, its oceans whisper, and its storms grieve.  
- **Exploration over Combat:** The focus is discovery, observation, and quiet interpretation rather than violence.  
- **Duality in Design:** Every element exists in opposition — light and shadow, erosion and rebirth, silence and thunder.

## Vision

“What has been will be again,
what has been done will be done again;
there is nothing new under the sun.”
— Ecclesiastes 1:9

Stargazer is a meditation on memory, creation, and consequence.
It asks: What remains after the end, and who remembers the forgotten gods of progress?
